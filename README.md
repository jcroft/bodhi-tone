This is a personal portfolio project of Jeffrey Croft, UX Engineer. It's a synthisizer built in Typescript and React, using the open source library Tone.js. It is unfinished, but in the end I hope it will be a suitable display of my frontend enginnering and UX design skills.

You can view a live deployment of this app at: https://bodhi-tone-git-main-jeff-crofts-projects.vercel.app/

Status: Core functionally working, business logic in decent shape, but UX design and development is just getting started.

I'm looking for work. Hire me! Find out more at http://jeffcroft.com, and contact me at jeffcroft@icloud.com.
